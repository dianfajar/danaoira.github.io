I've decided to focus on 3 topics for the coming months:

	1. Object-oriented programming
	2. Statistics
	3. SQL

I need to brush up on these concepts to full proficiency since I have not used them in a while.

I also plan to start keeping up with more Epidemiological journal publications to keep updated with the latest research.
