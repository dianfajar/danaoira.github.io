I took a trip to University of San Diego’s Graduate Commencement for a friend of mine who finished her Master’s degree.

The first and last time I was here was during my freshman year as an undergrad. It’s funny that my next visit would be after my first year of grad school.

Graduations have always been my favorite part of the school year.

My first job was at UC Irvine’s Commencement ceremony when I was a freshman. I sold parking permits for guests of the new graduates.

For three years, I watched tons of students in their caps and gowns with the widest smiles on their faces. For three years, I always felt the most overwhelming happiness for them. I could almost cry because I was so happy.

But in the back of my mind, I always had a lingering feeling of hope that some day that would be me.

I still haven’t changed.

As much as I wanted to enjoy the ceremony, the whole time I was at USD, I just kept thinking, “This will be me in two years. Just two more years!”

When I wasn’t stuck in my thoughts, I noticed that the graduate ceremony was different compared to graduating for your undergrad. The vibe was different. Everyone felt more mature and as the ceremony went on, I kept a feeling a deeper sense of honor and prestige with the higher level of academia.

The largest difference I noticed was the PhD hooding ceremony.

I remember seeing the Master’s hooding ceremony at Cal Poly Pomona’s commencement last spring. The graduates pulled their hoods over their head and that was about it.

For USD’s hooding ceremony, the professors actually put the hood on the new graduate themselves. I thought it was a nice touch.

Aside from the PhD academic regalia and their ceremony, what stood out to me the most was realizing that those people had reached the highest level of academia in their field.

It almost made me want to consider going for a PhD.

I’m not really sure if I would be able to since my experience is so deeply rooted in the industry. I also have a decent grade record, but not the best, but I always had this idea that PhD students were all perfect 4.0 students.

I feel like I need a take a few more CS classes to really see if I have a passion for research and eternal learning. So far, studying about finite state machines, algorithm design and finishing up all my discrete math and linear algebra have been helping a lot with boosting my interest in learning.

Even though I have my doubts, I won’t shut the door on that opportunity. At least not yet.
