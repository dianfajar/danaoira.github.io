I wanted to attend this meetup to get a demonstration of Python in action to get inspiration for building a data science toolkit. The presentation did not disappoint.

Unfortunately, the main speaker's flight was delayed, so an instructor at Galvanize stepped in to teach us.

It started with pizza, water and networking followed by some promotional information from Galvanize. Then the fun began.

The pacing was very quick, but still easy to follow. Having all the installs done from previous workshops took the headache out of missing the hands-on coding like I did in the TensorFlow tutorial hosted by Women in Big Data SF, but taught by Galvanize.

I was most fascinated by the amount of coverage on Pandas, which I hadn't tried out before. I really enjoyed the matrix multiplication and tensors slide! I was nerding out  so much seeing my favorite math being mentioned. I also enjoyed programming DataFrames and seeing it on Jupyter Notebooks.

They wrapped it up with simple Python problems, which didn't seem relevant to the Data Science portion, but was still good practice.

I did appreciate all the references for further learning. Also, the venue at Galvanize is amazing, so it's always nice to go to an event there.

I'm not sure I will enroll in a data science boot camp, but I will see after I finish the Coursera and Udemy courses I've enrolled in. I'm hoping to finish them by mid-February, which is an application deadline for one of the boot camps.
