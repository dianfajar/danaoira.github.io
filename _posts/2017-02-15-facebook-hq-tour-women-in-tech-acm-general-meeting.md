Today was a very inspirational day.

## Facebook Tour

I visited Facebook HQ with a friend who worked there and was able to get a tour of the campus. I have much respect for the company with [their presentations in Machine Learning and Big Data from the AI Frontiers Conference a few weeks back](https://danaoira.github.io/ai-frontiers-2017/). The campus didn't disappoint, and I definitely understand how a company that integrates art and inspiration into their workplace is able to deliver the products they have available.

## Discussing Women in Tech Over Milk Tea

After the tour, I met up with a friend I made at the [Women in Big Data](http://womeninbigdata.org) screening of the [Women in Data Science Conference at Intel](https://danaoira.github.io/women-in-data-science-conference-2017/). We caught each other up with our lives and goals in career and academia over some good old milk tea! It's very encouraging to find another woman in tech who's on a similar phase of life and career and even more empowering to be able to support one another and share our experiences.

## ACM General Meeting at MOVE, Inc.

In the evening, I volunteered for Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) San Francisco Bay Area Professional Chapter. The General Meeting's topic was titled "Experience Emerging Research and More Around Immersive Analytics" by Todd Margolis, Product Manager at Qlik.

My notes of the event are available here.

SF Bay Area ACM will also be uploading a video recording of the presentation [on their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sfbayacm) in the coming weeks.

The demo of AR using VR with the HoloLens on patient triage was very intriguing. I have entrepreneur friends who are interested in creating AR/VR products for healthcare, but they've been struggling with the challenge that what they want to create is not yet possible with the technology we have today. I felt this presentation was a nice step in the right direction to overcome the hesitation of my entrepreneur friend's realization of their product.

The best part of the night was being able to network with the guests at the event. Realtor.com/MOVE, Inc. provided ACM with the venue and were incredible to work with. I hope we can work with them again in the future because their venue, location, professionalism and camaraderie made the event very memorable. I had the opportunity to chat with their recruiters and head of their Data Science team and was very inspired with the work they were doing.

Lastly, I had good talks with my colleagues in the ACM Council. They mentioned that I may be a good fit for their Chair position of ACM Women (ACM-W), the subsidiary of ACM that outreaches to women in tech. That was exciting news to hear as I would be more than happy to give back to the community, especially through empowering women in tech.
