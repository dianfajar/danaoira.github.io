Today was the second annual Women in Data Science Conference ([#WIDS2017](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WIDS2017?src=hash)).

The actual event at Stanford University was sold out.

Luckily, [Women in Big Data](http://womeninbigdata.org) was hosting the livestream for free at Intel HQ in Santa Clara, so it was the next best thing sans the minor internet failure that Stanford had in the first 10 minutes of the livestream.

[Here are my notes from the conference](https://github.com/danaoira/Miscellaneous/blob/master/Notes/2017-02-03%20Women%20in%20Data%20Science%20Conference/2017-02-03-women-in-data-science-conference.ipynb) uploaded as a Jupyter Notebook on my GitHub.

Overall the conference was amazing. I was able to make friends with a PhD Material Sciences graduate from UCSD and two MS Statistics students from SJSU. Being able to make new connections and friends through these networking events is well worth it.

My favorite talks were from:

[Miriah Meyer, Assistant Professor, University of Utah](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=d2aadb16dbe727cb4d868aa138d79e979036824c&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f64616e616f6972612f4d697363656c6c616e656f75732f643261616462313664626537323763623464383638616131333864373965393739303336383234632f4e6f7465732f323031372d30322d3033253230576f6d656e253230696e25323044617461253230536369656e6365253230436f6e666572656e63652f323031372d30322d30332d776f6d656e2d696e2d646174612d736369656e63652d636f6e666572656e63652e6970796e62&nwo=danaoira%2FMiscellaneous&path=Notes%2F2017-02-03+Women+in+Data+Science+Conference%2F2017-02-03-women-in-data-science-conference.ipynb&repository_id=65120766#10:15-10:35am:-Miriah-Meyer,-Assistant-Professor,-University-of-Utah) who made me fall in love with data visualization all over again. Data visualization is what I hope to specialize in.

I was also most surprised to see my former employer, [Western Digital](http://wdc.com), make an appearance with [Janet George, Fellow and CDO, Western Digital](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=d2aadb16dbe727cb4d868aa138d79e979036824c&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f64616e616f6972612f4d697363656c6c616e656f75732f643261616462313664626537323763623464383638616131333864373965393739303336383234632f4e6f7465732f323031372d30322d3033253230576f6d656e253230696e25323044617461253230536369656e6365253230436f6e666572656e63652f323031372d30322d30332d776f6d656e2d696e2d646174612d736369656e63652d636f6e666572656e63652e6970796e62&nwo=danaoira%2FMiscellaneous&path=Notes%2F2017-02-03+Women+in+Data+Science+Conference%2F2017-02-03-women-in-data-science-conference.ipynb&repository_id=65120766#11:10-11:30am:-Janet-George,-Fellow-and-CDO,-Western-Digital).

Her talk was very technical, discussing the evolution of NAND from 2D to 3D to deal with the demands for higher storage capacity in our data-driven era. Luckily, the domain knowledge I gained from interning at Western Digital helped me keep up with the the extremely dense presentation.

The presentation gave me a deep appreciation for WD from how much I learned from interning with them.

Literally every piece of advice she gave was gold.

[Susan Holmes, Professor of Statistics, Stanford University](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=d2aadb16dbe727cb4d868aa138d79e979036824c&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f64616e616f6972612f4d697363656c6c616e656f75732f643261616462313664626537323763623464383638616131333864373965393739303336383234632f4e6f7465732f323031372d30322d3033253230576f6d656e253230696e25323044617461253230536369656e6365253230436f6e666572656e63652f323031372d30322d30332d776f6d656e2d696e2d646174612d736369656e63652d636f6e666572656e63652e6970796e62&nwo=danaoira%2FMiscellaneous&path=Notes%2F2017-02-03+Women+in+Data+Science+Conference%2F2017-02-03-women-in-data-science-conference.ipynb&repository_id=65120766#Reproducible-Research) had a wonderful presentation of Statistics and discovering botched data. I found her takeaway of making sure to be ethical and just with our data to ring very true and extremely important in this line of work where integrity of character is vital.

The [Career Panel](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=d2aadb16dbe727cb4d868aa138d79e979036824c&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f64616e616f6972612f4d697363656c6c616e656f75732f643261616462313664626537323763623464383638616131333864373965393739303336383234632f4e6f7465732f323031372d30322d3033253230576f6d656e253230696e25323044617461253230536369656e6365253230436f6e666572656e63652f323031372d30322d30332d776f6d656e2d696e2d646174612d736369656e63652d636f6e666572656e63652e6970796e62&nwo=danaoira%2FMiscellaneous&path=Notes%2F2017-02-03+Women+in+Data+Science+Conference%2F2017-02-03-women-in-data-science-conference.ipynb&repository_id=65120766#3:20-4:15pm-Career-Panel) was especially good. Most of the speakers had a lot good advice, which I found very encouraging and inspiring.

The career panel really is what set in stone my decision to apply for the PhD programs at Stanford. I'll save that for another post!

Overall, I'm very glad I braved the one-hour drive in the rain to attend the free screening.

I can't wait for the next WIDS Conference on February 1st, 2018!
