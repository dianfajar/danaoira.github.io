I decided that with the number of tech events and conferences I've been attending every week, it was time to ditch pulling up my LinkedIn profile on my phone to connect with people and go old fashioned - business cards!

Don't get me wrong - being able to pull up LinkedIn and connect with people has been a godsend. It just doesn't feel very professional at times, mostly due to the being on your phone part.
