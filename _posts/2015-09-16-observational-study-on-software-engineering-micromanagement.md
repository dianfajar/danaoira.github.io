The subject at hand was about micromanagement and a quote that a couple of my professors have been repeating lately:

> It's better to make mistakes in school and learn from them rather than making those mistakes in the real world.

I don't disagree with the quote. I actually appreciate that higher education offers this opportunity.

When I look at tough situations between classmates and team projects, I always reflect on how the situation was handled. Good? Bad? How did each person act in the project? How well did they do? What could they have improved on? Also, I put those thoughts on some sort of quantifiable metric (1-5 scale) to help make the evaluation easier.

From there, I pick out the things I want to apply to my every day life and things I never want to.

I spend a lot of time observing people - their mannerisms and their actions. I subconsciously measure them in a good/bad scale and take the good points that inspire me and try to apply them to my life. As for the bad, I use it as a focal point for learning what not to do. In the end, there's a lot to learn from people, even if it doesn't involve any conversation and is just purely observational.

Back to micromanagement, I'm turning it into an observational study. I understand the intention that my work was confusing since I left a draft and references on a section I was working on, but it was just unnecessary. I understand the paranoia of people who are aiming to get a good grade in class that they micromanage other people's work, but it's just so unnecessary.

I actually used to do a lot of micromanagement. Back in undergrad, I was the president of the sorority I was in. Sure, you get work done by taking it on yourself, but you don't always gain the respect of people when you do that.

To truly lead,Â you have to put your trust in the people that you're working with, give them the opportunity to fulfill their commitments and evaluate from there.
