I had the pleasure of attending AI Frontiers Conference thanks to my good tech friend and inspirational entrepreneur, [Erica Lee](http://twitter.com/ericaleefounder).Â She pitched her company, Collective Intelligence Technologies, at the start-up panel for Day 2. [Erin Jerri](http://twitter.com/erinjerri), an entrepreneur based in biotechnology AR/VR, joined us in the festivities and we had a great time needing out at latest and greatest Machine Learning and AI technologies that are upcoming.
