As I was heading home from a [meetup at Galvanize](https://danaoira.github.io/data-science-or-data-engineering/), I was brainstorming ideas on how to make a 2.0 version of my Masters Project, [Curriculum Graph Visualizer](https://github.com/danaoira/CurriculumGraphVisualizer), which will:

- Do PDF scraping to practice working with unstructured (big) data
- Do NLP using [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) on the scrape
- Optimize the translation/parsing from DOTS to Python GraphViz
- Incorporate a database to store multiple majors instead of just one major's requirements
- Make a web deployment (onto this GitHub site, hopefully)
- Fine-tune the algorithm for course suggestions (lower priority)

These are some of the things (and more) that I wanted to do for the project but didn't have enough time to do in the semester-long time frame, since the research and algorithm design took the longest.

I also want to incorporate more Data Science aspects to get some practice in. It might take a bit longer since I may deal with more development, but we shall see.

I think I may want to apply the [report aspect](https://github.com/danaoira/CurriculumGraphVisualizer/blob/master/deliverables/Final%20Report.pdf) to this project like for my Masters project. Having the formal list of items to fill out for the report made it very easy to translate it into a schedule and pace myself. I'll aim to finish the schedule planning by Monday.

I can't wait to start planning out a schedule for it and writing up the requirements!
