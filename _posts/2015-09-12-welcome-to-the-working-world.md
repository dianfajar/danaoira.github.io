"It is what it is."

Reality can really hit hard. I feel I am still a bit naive with experience in the industry, but it's slowly sinking in that I'm witnessing a dying industry.

Unfortunately, that's the nature of the technology industry. New innovations are being developed and practiced at such a rapid pace that if you can't keep up with the new, you'll be left behind.

Just as great empires can fall, so too can technological giants.

This epiphany has brought me to be proactive with this sudden change.

I'm three weeks into my last year of graduate school, but apparently I'm already applying "too late" for full-time positions in 2016. That news caught me off guard, but it makes sense with the amount of work that goes with job hunting:

- Job research
- Job requirements studying
- Applying
- Arranging interviews
- Traveling to interviews

It seems that applying around winter/spring works for summer internship programs. For permanent employment, the jobs seem to pop up post-summer, at the end of the fiscal year. (All from observation.)

As it is now, I'm taking 4 classes to finish up the rest of the classes for my graduate study plan. After this semester, I'll only have my master's project to work on. That will give enough time to travel for interviews while working on my project.

As far as locations I'm searching for, I am only interested in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, with more preference toward the former. My younger coworkers say that I'm limiting my chances by only choosing to apply in San Francisco, but I have my reasons.

Luckily, there are plenty opportunities for employment in San Francisco. Until then, the rest is up to hard work on my part and the right timing for applications.
