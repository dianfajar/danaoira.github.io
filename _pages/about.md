I started coding when I was 10 years old. I loved video games and anime, so I would make networks of fansites for fun. Making websites was a hobby of mine through high school.

I didn't think of it as anything more than a hobby and ended up going pre-pharmacy in college where I quickly realized going into the medical field wasn't what I wanted to do.

In the last two years of college, I landed a web development internship and rediscovered my love for making websites. In my last year of college, I took a course in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to apply the theory into web development.

I eventually kept landing more internships as a web developer, picking up some as well as internet marketing internships along the way.

By the time I was employed for 2 years in web development, I realized my knowledge in programmming was plateauing compared to my colleagues who had computer science/engineering degrees. They knowledge was what inspired me to go back to school and get a formal education in computer science.
