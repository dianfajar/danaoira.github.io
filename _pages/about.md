Hi, my name is Dana.

I am a web developer turned computer science graduate currently tinkering with data visualization.

I have extensive experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.

I like to translate things from the physical world and make them pretty all the down to the very last pixel on a screen, even with responsive design.

I have been making websites since I was 10 and am passionate about the internet, my childhood playground.
