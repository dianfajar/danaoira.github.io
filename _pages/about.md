**I like to say that I grew up with the Internet.** I started making websites in 1999 at 10 years old. I lived through the days of dial-up, web rings, Dynamic HTML, GreyMatter blogging, PHP's release and the web before social networks existed.

I studied Public Health in college, but my passion for development was still there. I received the opportunity of a lifetime when I was accepted to a MS Computer Science program and the rest was history.

Today, I am an advocate for [#WomenInComputing](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WomenInComputing) and [#ILookLikeAnEngineer](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ILookLikeAnEngineer). I organize tech events to the community with the [ACM SF Bay Area Chapter](http://sfbayacm.org/). I also regularly attend conferences and meetups on Data Visualization, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

I am a member of the following professional societies:

- [Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)](http://acm.org)
- [ACM Women (ACM-W)](http://women.acm.org/)
- [Women in Big Data (WiBD)](https://www.womeninbigdata.org/)
