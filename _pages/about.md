Hi, my name is Dana.

I am a web developer turned computer science graduate currently tinkering with data visualization. I have extensive experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I like to translate things from the physical world and make them pretty all the down to the very last pixel on a screen, even with responsive design. I've been making websites since I was 10 and am passionate about the internet, my childhood playground.

I have too many hobbies, but my current ones are streaming video games and playing with my pet bunnies, Lord Vader and Padme.

I want to create a version 2.0 of my Master's project, Curriculum Graph Visualizer. I want to uproot it from its console-run UI to an interactive web visualization.
